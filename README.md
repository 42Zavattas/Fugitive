# Fugitive

> no ads, no bullshit, real privacy

Have you ever dreamed about a service allowing you to create throwable links to share, without leaving some kind of dirty trail behind you?

Well, that's where **Fugtive** came.

In less than 3 seconds (2 on a Dvorak keyboard), you'll be able to get on the site, paste your link, press enter and finally copy the *furtive link*.

<br>
All the links redirect bots (Google, Facebook...) to a RickRoll and will not disclose the content of the link you share to a real person.

There is some more advanced features like time based expiration, specific number of hits to expire, a custom redirect upon expiration, and even country redirect overrides! An expired link will always be **TRULLY** deleted, no track.

<br>
We also have implemented the God Login, aka *Lognup*, a new system where you only have to set your mail to get ready to use the site with more features availables. This sent you a link that will be available only one time. No more *forgot password headache*.


And then, some gonna say that it already exists since a long time ago. Are you talking about [this shitty thing](http://urlgone.com/)? Please... Have some respect.
